2) About section
3) Rules

Solution-It's a spoonerism, got to use *fightingaliar* to pass

KryptexPage4: Level 3
Use *patience* to pass

kryptexPage12:
Zoom down to pass

KruptexPage14:
Use *hugh* to pass, which is common between Hugh Laurie and Hugh Jackman.

KryptexPage15:

KryptexPage16:
Answer is "water". To kill fire you need water.

KryptexPage17:
Answer is 'eve'. Need to make the hint 'throwback' consistent with title when we rearrange levels.

KryptexPages 15,20,22 have two text areas, need separate AJAX calls

Level 23 has different NAC at separate times, need to figure a way out.
Level 13 not created.
Level 22 has a wrong XOR value, change image
